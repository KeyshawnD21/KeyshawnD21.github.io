<h1 id="h-1">What Training with Me is Like</h1>
<p>I believe that Exercise is Medicine! My training will develop your energy systems and help you grow physically and mentally into a better version of you! I find what works for each individual and tailor your training based on those findings! Helping others reach their goals without sacrificing everything their daily lives is what I love to do. I intend for my clients to still be able to live their everyday lives, eating most of their favorite foods and enjoying their favorite activities while still working towards their fitness goals. Working with me will take all the guesswork out, so you can live your life with balance while consistently working towards your goals.</p>


<h1 id="h-2">How I Got Started</h1>
    <p>I played football and ran track throughout high school and for 5.5 years in college at St. Cloud State University and Minnesota State University, Mankato. I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Sciences in 2018. Competing at a very high level for so long left me with a passion and desire to continue to get better. To do so, I needed education, so I pursued my MS Exercise Physiology at Minnesota State University, Mankato. During my time in graduate school, I completed an internship at Englebert Training Systems (ETS) Performance where I studied the philosophy of training athletes under Faryn Wirkus. Also, during that time I began exploring the world of bodybuilding. Seeing the results of training in a new way became addicting and I fell in love with it. Furthering my education continues to increase my knowledge of the bodyâ€™s energy systems and better my understanding of nutrition and dieting along with training.</p>
