<h1>Training Philosophy</h1>

<h2>How I Got Started</h2>
    <p>I played football and ran track throughout high school and for 5.5 years in college at St. Cloud State University and Minnesota State University, Mankato. I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Sciences in 2018. Competing at a very high level for so long left me with a passion and desire to continue to get better. To do so, I needed education, so I pursued my MS Exercise Physiology at Minnesota State University, Mankato. During my time in graduate school, I completed an internship at Englebert Training Systems (ETS) Performance where I studied the philosophy of training athletes under Faryn Wirkus. Also, during that time I began exploring the world of bodybuilding. Seeing the results of training in a new way became addicting and I fell in love with it. Furthering my education continues to increase my knowledge of the bodyâ€™s energy systems and better my understanding of nutrition and dieting along with training.</p>
